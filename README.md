# VanceGPT
This is an attempt at making VanceBot - a chatbot equipped with my tone and experiences.

 I will use OpenAI's API, feeding it years of my conversations and images to train it on how I write conversationally as well as information from my life.

Downloading messenger data to feed modle conversational info.


See openai-node for working basic VanceGPT. Sorting conversation data to feed to model. Iniital test with small amount of data was successful
Will start collaborating with Amir more
Testing how contributions work
